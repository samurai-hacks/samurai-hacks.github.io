Welcome to my blog.

0hmsec is my pen-name that I use for this blog.

I want to document my journey into the field of Cyber Security and give back to the wonderful community out there.

I am an OSCP+ certified, one of many certifications that are yet to come.

I will be posting writeups for retired CTF machines that are on Hack the Box, PG Practice etc., So, stay tuned.

If there is anything that you would want me to explore/write about, you can reach me on one of the socials.

If you like my content and would like to support you can show your appreciation by Buying me a coffee.
